#### Starting off on Computational Chemistry

I've recently token an interesting in chemistry and would like to combine my degree with something I enjoy learning. 
So, I'm starting off my adventure with a beginners [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YF-amZgE2h4&list=PLm8ZSArAXicIWTHEWgHG5mDr8YbrdcN1K&ab_channel=TMPChem) guide to help me out. 
The goal of these videos is to get the basic understanding of what I'm really getting into and to allow me to create project I had on mind. 

Enjoy some of my notes I will be doing on Juypter Notebook :)
